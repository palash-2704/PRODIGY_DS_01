, which contains population records spanning from 2001 to 2022.

Tools and Libraries Used

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
As part of the EDA, the following steps were carried out:

Data Cleaning: Identified and addressed any missing values, duplicate entries, and outliers within the dataset.

Visualization: Used bar charts and stacked charts to represent the distribution of both categorical and continuous variables effectively.

Conclusion
To summarize, the EDA offered meaningful insights into how the selected variables are distributed within the dataset. These findings serve as a solid starting point for deeper analysis and modeling in the data science pipeline.
